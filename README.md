__Introduction__

A single header library for bipartite matching (WIP).

__Dependencies__

- C++23

__Note: Work in progress__

This project was made to solve a particular problem, so it lacks polish (and more options other than maximum).

The goal was to solve how to sort a matrix, such that the major diagonal is non-zero, for use in Gauss Jordan elimination. If possible `Bipartite_Matching::Maximum` will return with an edge count equal to columns.
